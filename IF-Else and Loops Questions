        IF ELSE-IF ELSE QUESTIONS

        Question 1 What is the purpose of the if-else statement in programming?
        Answer: The if-else statement is used to make decisions in code. It allows you to
        execute different blocks of code based on a specified condition.

        Question 2 Write a Java program to check if a number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter a number");
        int num = sc.nextInt();
        if(num%2==0){
            System.out.println(num+" is EVEN");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println(num+" is ODD");
        }

        Question 3 Write a Java program to find the largest of three numbers using if-else.
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter a number");

        int num1= sc.nextInt();
        int num2= sc.nextInt();
        int num3= sc.nextInt();

        if(num1>num2 && num1>num3){
            System.out.println(num1 + " IS GREATER");
        } else if (num2>num1 && num2>num3) {
            System.out.println(num2 + " IS GREATER");
        }else {
            System.out.println(num3 + " IS GREATER");
        }

        Question 4 Write a Java program to determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else.
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter a number");
        int num = sc.nextInt();
        if(num>=0){
            System.out.println(num+ " is POSITIVE");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println(num+ " is NEGATIVE");
        }

        Question 5  You are working on a sports team management system. You need to write a Java program that matches a player to a team based on their age. The rules for matching players to teams are as follows:
        If a player is 8 years old and younger till 5 years, they are assigned to the "Young Kids" team.
        If a player is between 9 and 12 years old (inclusive), they are assigned to the "Junior Team."
        If a player is 13 years or older, they are assigned to the "Senior Team."

        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter a player's age?");
        int age=sc.nextInt();

        if(age<=8 && age>=5){
            System.out.println("Player is assigned to the Young Kids team.");
        } else if (age>=9 && age<=12) {
            System.out.println("Player is assigned to the Junior Team.");
        }else if (age>=13){
            System.out.println("Player is assigned to the Senior Team.");
        }else {
            System.out.println("Invalid Age");
        }

        LOOPS QUESTIONS

        while loops

        Question no 1: Write a Java program that uses a while loop to count down from a given number to 1, and then print "Blastoff!" when it reaches 1.
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int n = input.nextInt();

        while (n >= 1) {
            System.out.println(n);
            n--;
        }
        System.out.println("Blastoff!");

        // Question no. 2: Write a Java program that uses a while loop to calculate the sum of the first 100 positive integers.
        int sum=0;
        int i=1;
        while (i<=100){
                sum=sum+i;
                i++;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);

        For Loops

        QUestion 1: Write a Java program that uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.
        for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){
            System.out.println(i);
        }

        Question 2: Write a Java program to calculate the sum of the first 10 natural numbers using a for loop.
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){
            sum=sum+i;

        }
        System.out.println("The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is:" + sum);*/

        
    }
    }
